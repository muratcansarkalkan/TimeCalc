# TimeCalc

I am trying to make a time calculator for freecodecamp's Python tutorial.

"Write a function named add_time that takes in two required parameters and one optional parameter:

a start time in the 12-hour clock format (ending in AM or PM)
a duration time that indicates the number of hours and minutes
(optional) a starting day of the week, case insensitive
"

I managed to do the example project thanks to zaneaw's TimeCalc explanation.
